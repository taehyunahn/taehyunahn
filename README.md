# Hi, I'm Peter 👋

I'm a Korean developer who made a significant career shift from international development to software development in my 30s. My journey began in Mongolia and Uganda, where I worked with KOICA in the international development sector. It was during this time that I witnessed the transformative power of IT in driving market innovation and improving lives in developing countries. Inspired by this, I decided to pursue a career in coding.

## 🔧 Skills & Expertise
- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
- **Experience**: Web Development, Android App Development
- **Current Role**: Developer at an HR Cloud Software Service Company

## 🌍 My Journey
My passion for technology was ignited while working in developing nations, where I saw firsthand how IT could revolutionize lives. Now, I'm on a mission to grow as a developer and eventually return to these regions as both a developer and a businessman, working to improve lives through technology. Currently, I'm balancing this ambition with my role as a father of three (a 4-year-old daughter and 100-day-old twins) while on a 3-month paternity leave.
